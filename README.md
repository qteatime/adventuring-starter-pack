# Adventuring Starter Pack

Your number one companion for tackling the dark realms of the Spire.
In this package you will find all of the things you need (and some
that you don't really need, but why not have anyway?), guaranteeing
a cozy time in Crochet-land.

Be sure to follow along [The Crocheted Adventure][adv] book to
enjoy this package as designed :)

## Using this package

Once you have Crochet set up (this requires 0.13.1), run the following
in your terminal:

    $ crochet launcher:server --project-directory <path/to/this/folder>

Be sure to replace `<path/to/this/folder>` with the path to this folder :)

Alternatively, when using Node.js you can run:

    $ npm start
